# esx_policejob-with-animations
Here is an edited version of the esx_policejob with arrest animations. This is in testing and there might be a bug or two, if so, let me know on GitHub and I will try to fix it.

Credit goes to the creator of the 'esx_policejob' script, I have adjusted it and edited the script and added code, therefore it is still his code, just edited by me since a lot of people were trying to get one with animations, so I have made one and released it to the public.
